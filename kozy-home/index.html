              With extremely low startup costs, virtually zero overhead, and the
              ability to be up and running in literally days after coming on
              board, Kozy Home allows you to have your own business selling
              furniture and related items from wherever you happen to be. In
              fact, the founder got started displaying furniture in her home!
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides selling directly to customers, you can also sell to
              professionals who need quality furniture at reasonable rates. For
              instance, real estate agents may want to stage the homes they're
              selling. Local small businesses, such as attorneys or CPAs, might
              love to add another revenue stream by displaying furniture for
              sale in their waiting rooms. Start your own home staging business,
              or supply others. And on and on it goes!
            </p>
            <p>
              You may even have an existing customer base to sell to! Real
              estate and insurance agents have a natural outlet for adding Kozy
              Home, as do home decorators and interior designers, or anyone who
              just has a good eye for setting up a room.

          Don't have the creative skills to stage rooms? Not interested in

        </h2>
        <p>
          No problem; you'll get training and mentoring to help you connect with
          and supply people in your area who have those skills, as well as help
          with advertising and even setting up a local team of FurnitureBROKERS
          to refer business straight to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, you'll get access to ongoing training and personal mentoring
          to make sure your business is not only profitable, but enjoyable. This
          isn't just any old “mentoring program” either; it's direct access to
          people who have operated Kozy Home successfully and profitably, and
          love what they do!
        </p>
        <p>
          I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of what's possible with
          Kozy Home, but if any of this has gotten your creative juices flowing,
          please get in touch for more information and someone will be happy to
          help you decide if Kozy Home is a good fit for what you bring to the
          table!
