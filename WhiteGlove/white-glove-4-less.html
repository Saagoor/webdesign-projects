            Larry Kozin, founder of New Economy Marketing Group and White
            Glove 4 Less, has over thirty years&#39; experience in the
            furniture industry and has always been frustrated by the
            logistics. High costs, pricing structures that make no sense,
            damage in shipment, and delayed orders were some of the more major
            headaches.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowing his struggles are shared by other furniture store owners
            around the country, Larry&nbsp;decided to build a new logistics
            company, purpose-built for the furniture industry, to address
            these needs. White Glove 4 Less (WG4L) is the result.

                <h3 class="h2">The Business</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to all the above, White Glove 4 Less goes yet further
                    by adopting Uber-like technology and applying it to deliveries!
                    Store owners, and even individuals, can use an app to enter
                    details for adelivery. Then,&nbsp;nearby WG4L drivers are alerted
                    that a delivery is ready. The speed and convenience this
                    technology bring to the table can open opportunities that never
                    would have existed otherwise!

                </div>
                <h3 class="h2">The Opportunity</h3>
                <p>
                    Currently in its pre-launch phase, WG4L is laying the groundwork
                    to build a nationwide network of independent owner/operators to
                    handle both &#8220;last mile&#8221; and &#8220;less than
                    load&#8221; shipments and deliveries of furniture and similar
                    merchandise. Driver signups will open soon, but for now, licensees
                    are needed at the state, regional, and local levels.
                  </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-4 pt-4 pt-lg-0">

                </div>
                <h3 class="h2">What's in it for me?</h3>
                <p>
                    This can be a completely passive investment, as a nationwide
                    marketing effort will be made to recruit drivers and which can be
                    geo-targetted to your territory. However, those who wish to have a
                    more active role may reasonably expect to see a quicker (and
                    larger) return on investment. Either way, your long-term passive
                    income will grow as the WG4L network expands in your territory!
